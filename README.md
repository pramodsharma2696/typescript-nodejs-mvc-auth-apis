### Project Description

This is a Node.js and Express-based API with user authentication and authorization functionality. It uses **MongoDB** for data storage, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication. The API includes a registration and login system, along with a protected profile route that requires authentication.

### Key Features

* **User Registration**: Allows new users to sign up with their details (email, password, name, and role).
* **User Login**: Users can log in with their credentials (email and password) to receive a **JWT** for authentication.
* **Profile Endpoint**: A protected route (`/profile`) where users can view their profile information after being authenticated with a JWT.
* **Token-based Authentication**: The API uses **JWT** to securely authenticate users and manage session states.
* **Password Hashing**: The user password is securely hashed before saving it to the database using **bcrypt** to prevent storing passwords in plaintext.

### Technologies Used

* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
* **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
* **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user information and other application data.
* **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and generating access tokens.
* **Bcrypt.js**: A library to hash and compare passwords securely.
* **Zod**: A schema validation library for validating user input data for signup and login requests.
* **ms**: A small utility to handle time formatting for token expiration.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and define the following:

     ```env
     JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
     JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
     ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Routes

* `POST /register`: Register a new user with email, password, and role.
* `POST /login`: Login with email and password to receive a JWT.
* `GET /profile`: Fetch the profile information of the authenticated user (requires JWT).

### Middleware

* **Authentication Middleware**: Protects routes by verifying the JWT in the `Authorization` header or cookies.
* **Zod Validation Middleware**: Validates the incoming request data for registration and login.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple yet secure implementation of user authentication with JWT in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides essential features like user registration, login, and protected routes, which can be expanded for more complex applications.
